The application is hosted on Azure App Service, ensuring scalability and reliable performance.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login using Azure Entra ID B2C, supporting email/password authentication.
- **Membership Management**: Efficient handling of membership registration, renewals, and cancellations.
- **Membership Payments Processing**: Use of Square as payment processor for New Membership and Renewals
- **Facebook Events Synchronization**: Automatic synchronization of public events from the [Oviedo Jeep Club Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/oviedojeeple) using the Facebook Graph API.
- **Email Communications**: Automated email notifications via Azure Email Communication Service.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Pip:** The Python package installer.
- **Azure Entra ID B2C tenant configured
- **Facebook Developer account with access to the Graph API
- **Square Developer account with access to the Payments API

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oviedojeeple/oviedojeepclub.git
   cd oviedojeeple/oviedojeepclub
   
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   4. **Run the Application:**

   You can start the application by executing the startup script or by running the Flask app directly:
   
   Using the startup script:
   ```bash
   ./startup.sh

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   python app.py

4. **Configuration:**

   Set environment variables for Azure authentication, email service, and Facebook API access:
  
   ```bash
   export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
   export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
   export AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
   export FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID="your-facebook-page-id"
   export FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-facebook-access-token"
   ```
  
   Obtain the `FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the [Facebook Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started/).


## Usage

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the specified port) to view the application.
- The landing page (`index.html`) will load first, with links to the privacy policy and data deletion pages.
- JavaScript files handle interactive components like user profiles and payment processing.

## Development

### Code Organization

- **Backend (`app.py`):**  
  Handles routing, data processing, and rendering HTML templates.
- **Templates:**  
  HTML files in the `templates` folder that structure the website.
- **Static Files:**  
  CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactive features, and images for branding are all located in the `static` folder.

### Customization

- **Styling:**  
  Modify `static/style.css` to change the appearance of the site.
- **JavaScript:**  
  Enhance or update interactivity by editing the files in `static/scripts/`.
- **Templates:**  
  Update content and structure by editing files in the `templates` folder.

## Running the Application

Set Flask application environment variable:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

Run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Deployment

The application is configured for Azure App Service deployment using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/azure-webapps-deploy.yml`). Ensure Azure credentials and secrets are set in GitHub repository settings.

Manual deployment instructions: [Microsoft Quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask).

## Facebook Events Synchronization

The `utilities/facebook_events.py` module interacts with the Facebook Graph API to fetch and update events:

1. Create a Facebook App at [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).
2. Generate a long-lived Access Token with `pages_read_engagement` permission.
3. Schedule synchronization with `event_uploader.py`.

## Email Communications

Automated emails via Azure Email Communication Service. Follow [Azure's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/email/send-email) for setup.

## Secure Sessions

Secure sessions with dynamic Flask secret keys. Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable accordingly.
